Activity with the pulse range finder

This program runs the laserPING 2m rangefinder which in this case was run through pin 2 on a esp32s2 chip
The program will run the rangefinder and print out the pulse in miliseconds, which in my case was also connect to a 16x2 lcd screen which had displayed the resutls in pulse.
